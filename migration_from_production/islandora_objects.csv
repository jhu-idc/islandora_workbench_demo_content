Dr. Russell Morgan, Director of Radiology Dept. at Johns Hopkins University, fields questions from members of the press: Nate Hazeltine, a ""Washington Post"" science writer; Pare Lorentz, a film producer; and Earl Ubell, a reporter and science editor with the ""New York Herald Tribune"". Dr. Morgan explains that x-rays affect both individual cells and the whole body, making them more susceptible to premature aging. He discusses the research by John Lawrence on the effects of radiation on mice and their extrapolation to man. He also notes a study on radiation vs. non-radiation workers that showed no difference in life spans of the two groups. It is the amount of radiation exposure that determines the effects of the damage. For example, a chest x-ray only delivers about 1/20th roentgen, a unit of radiation. However, Dr. Morgan discusses the feasibility of a reporting system for patients' total x-ray exposure and the need for a set of standards. And he does admit that the complexity and amount of radiation exposure is increasing in diagnostic studies and could double by 1960-65. A film clip demonstrates that this radiation exposure can be reduced by filtration, distance from the x-ray machine, length of time of exposure, and protection of areas not being radiated. Mr. Poole points out that Dr. Morgan has developed a fluoroscopy machine reducing by up to ten times the radiation time. In conclusion, Dr. Morgan discusses whether the Atomic Energy Commission or the U. S. Public Health Services should be responsible for the public's radiation health problems.",Public digital access,Science Review,"relators:brd:ABC Television Network||relators:drt:Calfee, Kennard||relators:nrt:Chaseman, Joel||relators:prd:Hazeltine, Nate||relators:prd:Lorentz, Pare||relators:prd:Morgan, Russell H.

Later, Frenchman Niepce discovered an emulsion that could retain a photographic image. Dr. Walter Driscoll, director of research at Baird-Atomic Inc., then shows a chart of the electromagnetic spectrum and notes that while x-rays yield only shadowy pictures and radar waves detect but don't create pictures, germanium and silicon filters block radiated energy and allow infrared light to pass through to form an image. Dr. Driscoll displays a scanning bolometer, which can see in the dark, but the shapes it creates need to be interpreted. He also shows a snooperscope and a film clip of a sniperscope with infrared scope. Previous research on infrared or thermal detection was done by Sir John Frederick William Herschel. Potter Trainer demonstrates and explains the Evaporagraph (EVA), which is based on the principle that all things radiate heat as infrared rays, and shows some of the actual pictures made from heat rather than light. Dr. Walter Baird describes applications of EVA to industry, such as detecting problem-causing hot spots in electronic equipment or indicating heat escape or insulation deficiency in a building. EVA's resolution is 10 lines/mm at best, and it shows temperature contrast of .2 degree. The machine's weakness is the slow speed of response to small temperature differences and the inability to obtain the temperature scale of the item viewed.

A film clip shows the sun's surface and its energy generation is discussed. John Yellott, executive director for the Association for Applied Solar Energy, says that space heating will be the first large use of solar energy. He explains the workings of a solar-heated house with auxiliary heat pump designed by University of Minnesota architecture student Peter Lee and engineered by Bridgers and Paxton. According to Mr. Yellot, the basic instruments of solar energy are collectors, concentrators, photoelectricity, and photochemistry. He shows how solar stills can convert salt water into fresh; solar furnaces can be used for metallurgy and other research; and solar stoves can be designed for arid countries where fuel is scarce. Mr. Poole uses a photo flood light to light a cigarette and shows how selenium cells operate a photoelectric exposure meter and 8mm movie camera. Mr. Yellott demonstrates a radio/phonograph developed by Admiral Corp. to run on solar cells with backup storage batteries.

Dr. Donald Andrews, chemistry professor at Johns Hopkins University, says that man has learned how to harness and control the atom's energy in such projects as atomic submarines and power plants, but we can not yet harness or control hydrogen, the newest source of nuclear power. To do that, machines need to supplement man's brain, offering ""automatic control"" or cybernetics. Examples of this include analog machines that regulate single functions, like James Watts' fly ball governor to control steam to the engine (demonstrated in animated film), thermostats that work on a feedback loop, servoengines that correct the course of a ship, and automated pilots on planes. Dr. Andrews then demonstrates thermodynamics, which studies the relations between heat and motion, and shows visible and audible evidence of a gas using dry ice. He defines entropy as the degree of randomness in a situation expressed by probabilities. Claude Shannon was the first person to see the parallel between entropy and the theory of information, which makes possible more complex automatic control devices. Self-regulating machines still need human monitoring, but digital information machines, or computers, can handle more complex situations, such as reacting to emergencies. A filmed narrative describes IBM's Model 705 equipment and statistics. Dr. Andrews says that computers will become the instruments of overall control. Cartoons show the statistics, promises, and fears of mechanization in business, industry, and government, concluding that by 1965, the United States, with a population of 190,000,000 will require a 50% increase in production. Dr. Andrews also predicts that in the future automatic control machines will make possible automatically steered cars, continuous television with an on-request program selector for shows in full color and 3-D, interplanetary transportation within 100 years, and modification of conditions on other planets by robots for colonization of space. The program concludes with a brief film of the launching of an artificial earth satellite placed in orbit by a three-stage rocket as America's contribution to the 1957-58 International Geophysical Year.",Public digital access,Science Review,"relators:brd:ABC Television Network||relators:drt:Calfee, Kennard||relators:nrt:Chaseman, Joel||relators:prd:Andrews, Donald H.

Dr. William A. McDonald, assistant director of the Baltimore Museum of Art, explains the artist's creative process. He compares naturalism vs. emotional reaction to a subject by comparing two paintings of cats. Artists may distort form, color, or size to emphasize qualities that are important. Both artists and sculptors use horizontal lines to express serenity and diagonal or curved lines for movement, as exemplified in the dance movements of a Kirchner painting and a Matisse sculpture. Dr. McDonald discusses the heavy black lines, borrowed from stained glass making, in Georges Rouault's ""The Crucifixion,"" and the swirling lines in Vincent Van Gogh's ""Starry Night,"" an example of expressionism. The German expressionists were influenced by the abstract art of Africa and used lines to evoke inner feelings. Displayed examples of this school include a Pechstein woodcut, a Kathe Kollwitz drawing, a Heckel self-portrait, and Miro's happier painting ""Summer."" Dr. McDonald explains the use of distortion in El Greco's ""Laokoon"" and Pablo Picasso's ""Guernica,"" which he compares with Orozco's ""Dive Bomber and Tank"" shown in the opening of the program.",Public digital access,Science Review,"relators:brd:ABC Television Network||relators:drt:Calfee, Kennard||relators:prd:McDonald, William A.

Dr. Sidney Painter, professor of history at The Johns Hopkins University, discusses chivalry, from the French ""chevalier"", or knight, referring to the ideals of the knightly class. He summarizes the events of the Middle Ages and notes that warfare and women were the guiding influences of that period. The knights, originally barbarous in desires and actions, listened to ""chansons de geste"", poems of war, but they became more civilized as troubadours changed their tunes. ""The Story of Roland"", for example, suggests that knights were to protect the church and punish criminals. Courtly poems laid the foundation for ""preux"", a term denoting prowess and all the virtues of chivalry.

A chart shows single-celled organisms, such as amoebae, and Dr. Monty comments on reproduction from a single cell. The 1953 Urey-Miller experiment attempted to recreate the conditions of the primordial atmosphere with carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen resulting in the precursors of amino acids, the main components of living cells. Scientist Sidney Fox also discovered that amino acids will organize spontaneously into protein molecules. Animated segments show amino acids, proteins, and nucleotides and how accidents in the original cells resulted in mutation, heredity, and evolution. Nucleic acids are the carriers of heredity and responsible for transformation.

The three types of joints he lists are the fused in the skull, the hinge-type in the elbow, and the ball and socket in the shoulder and hip. Investigating the interior of bones, Dr. Montagna shows the frontal sinuses of the head and compares the spongy bone material at each end of a bone to a bridge structure. For strength and resiliency, bones require both organic and inorganic substance, which Dr. Montagna demonstrates with bones lacking one or the other. A diagram shows how the endosteum and the periosteum balance bone growth. X-ray films compare the hands of a three-year-old, which has cartilage at the end of each bone, and a thirty-year-old, which has bone in place.

From evidence such as stone tools, Dr. Carter speculates that man entered America about 40,000 years ago. He creates a timeline based on the degree of skill in making tools, the degree of weathering on tools, and the date of the existence of the lake where the tools were found.

In the area of life sciences, biology professor William McElroy discusses nutritional requirements to relieve diseases, trapping solar energy, the physiology of space travel, insights on aging, and other possibilities in a ""golden age of medicine."" Professor of microbiology Thomas B. Turner predicts space medicine, electronic equipment for the handicapped, public protection against radioactivity, better surgical methods for transplants, and the reduction or elimination of heart disease, polio, and cancer. Professor Charles Singleton maintains that the humanities will continue to survive as long as we ask ""What is a man?"" and ""What does it mean to be where we are?"" In communications, chemistry professor Donald Hatch predicts the extension of television networks as well as 3-D television programs and programs on demand. Professor of physics Theodore Berlin lists future energy issues such as control of thermonuclear fusion reactions, problems with radioactive wastes, application of atomic energy (but not in homes or vehicles), transformation of devices to control energy, and development of solid fuels and solar energy. According to Francis Clauser, professor of aeronautics, in the realm of space travel, commercial airlines will fly at supersonic speeds; guided missiles and anti-missile devices will be the backbone of defense; the U.S. will enjoy peaceful space travel with the Russians; and a rocket will go to the moon. To reinforce this view, Wernher von Braun, in a taped segment, predicts that the U.S. will launch a man into outer space, he will orbit and return to earth.

Lynn Poole lists some of the history of the research on brain functions, including that of the early German phrenologist Franz Joseph Gall. In 1817 it was demonstrated that electrical stimulus applied to the brain produced movement on the opposite side of the brain, giving rise to the existence of motor areas of the brain. Using a brain cross-section diagram related to various parts of the body, Dr. Walker shows how the sensory cortex, or homunculus, is closely correlated with the motor cortex. He also discusses what happens when these areas are injured and how they affect vision, hearing, and speech. The association area of the brain is the temporal lobe.

This first political protest after the American Revolution was a precursor of Jacksonian democracy and led to the creation of the U.S. Constitution. At issue were the farmers caught between mounting debts and insufficient gold-backed paper currency in circulation. In numerous towns in western Massachusetts, such as Northampton, Worcester, Great Barrington, armed mobs prevented the supreme judicial courts from sitting and sending debtors to prison. They were led by Capt. Daniel Shays, a veteran of the Revolution and farmer from Pelham, MA. Gen. Lincoln's army was sent to suppress the insurrections and protect the judicial courts. On January 25, 1787, Shays' rebels attacked the arsenal at Springfield, MA, but were rebuffed by Gen. Shepard's troops. With the exception of two, the rebels were pardoned after asking forgiveness, and the government made the reforms they sought.

He asks a member of that Lab, Dr. Richard Kershner, to explain how the missile works and how it was developed. Dr. Kershner shows a film of the missile in action, noting that it doesn't actually hit the target but explodes within close proximity of it. On a mock-up he identifies the payload or warhead and the solid fuel rocket engine with booster rocket. The guidance control system allows ""beam riding"" as the onboard computer corrects the missile's course, and the missile's antennae pick up the intensity of the radar beams' mutations. A transmitter on the ground sends a reference signal to the receiver on the missile, a signature beam that prevents jamming by other radar beams. The electronic information received permits the four hydraulic tail fins to control its flight altitude. Dr. Kershner also explains a model of one of the terrier's control units. The first beam-rider missile was begun in 1947, and its problems were gradually eliminated, as shown in a film shot from a booster section showing ""flutter."" Development of such complex missiles requires not only a team of specialists in many fields but also systems engineers or specialty generalists to produce an integrated final product.

Dance was originally solo and then social. Shawn shows a film of Australian aborigines dancing their stories and film clips of liturgical dance. Dance has long been a form of religious expression and ecstasy. Shawn shows photos and film clips of some of his dances based on religious themes such as the whirling dervish, St. Francis, and Shiva. He discusses turn of the century dance, which used very sterile technical styles. However, Isadora Duncan and Ruth St. Denis initiated the renaissance of dance and the forerunner of modern dance. Film footage shows St. Denis's 1910 ""Incense"" and Shawn and St. Denis in ""Tillers of the Soil.""

Dr. William Avery, of Johns Hopkins University's Applied Physics Lab, describes how techniques of flight have changed from the Chinese rocket of 1232 AD to the ramjet. Isaac Newton's equal and opposite principle was the basis for jet propulsion, and its first use was in jet-assisted takeoffs, which allowed shorter runways. Dr. Avery shows a diagram of a solid fuel rocket consisting of propellant grain, nozzle, and warhead and contrasts it with a liquid propellant rocket consisting of rocket fuel and oxidizer tanks, combustion chamber, warhead, and valves and pumps. He notes that liquid fuel rockets are more subject to failure than solid fuel ones. Dr. Avery briefly describes the work of rocket pioneers Tsiolkovskiy, Goddard, and Oberth. Further research in the field resulted in the air-breathing engine during World War II, pulse jet engine (loud and limited in speed), turbojet engine by Briton Frank Whittle, and ramjet engine, first proposed by Rene Lorin in 1910 but requiring supersonic speed. Dr. Avery describes the key components of the ramjet: the diffuser, fuel system, and combustor. He then explains graphs comparing the ramjet and turbojet in four areas of performance and limitations: thrust per unit frontal area, specific fuel impulse, thrust per unit weight, and speed and altitude limits, proving ramjet the more economical to use.

In 1932, Karl Jansky, from Bell Labs, discovered radio noise from space. Five years later Grote Reber built the first antenna for astronomical observations. The sun was discovered to be a source of radiation and radio waves, as were the Milky Way and Crab Nebula. Later J. G. Bolton and J. G. Stanley discovered a variable source of cosmic radio frequency radiation in the constellation Cygnus. That plus Cassiopeia are the most intense radio sources in the heavens. Additional research resulted in Martin Ryle's development of interferometric techniques, A. E. Lilly's observation of the spiral structure of the universe, and J. H. Oort's mapping of our own galaxy. In 1944, H. Van de Hulst predicted that a hydrogen cloud produces radiation in the radio range of 21cm wavelength. E. Purcell and H. Ewen confirmed this theory, detecting a 21cm cosmic gas emission from neutral hydrogen in the Milky Way in 1951. Ohio University's John Kraus was instrumental in detecting the Milky Way's radio transmissions. In 1955, the Mills Cross Array, a simple radio antenna built by Australian B. Mills, was used to record the radio noise produced by the planet Jupiter. The antenna most commonly used is the paraboloidal reflector with a diameter of 80-90 ft. The largest steerable radio reflector is at Jodrell Bank in the UK. Plans for the National Radio Astronomical Observatory at Green Bank, West Virginia are underway at the time of this program.

Dr. Boas responds that there are four reasons for problems becoming obsolete, and he gives examples of each: they are insoluble; peoples' interests change; they arise from assumptions no longer held; and the problems themselves go out of style. When Mr. Poole asks if there are any humanistic problems whose solution would affect the lives of many people, Dr. Boas lists standardized textbooks in education, the trend towards authoritarianism, and the elimination of provincialism. He notes that there is no one right answer in the humanities; every person is his own interpreter.

Dr. Robert Huntoon points out that the earth's rotation varies, so to determine the exact time, the NBS uses quartz crystals, or for more accuracy, ammonium atom vibration or a cesium clock operating on the forces within the cesium atom.

Since ancient pottery styles changed readily, relative chronology of a culture can be based on these changes.

He then gives the history of Mars from Francesco Fontana's 1636 drawing of the planet to Christian Huygens' comments on possible inhabitants of Mars and Giovanni Schiaparelli's 1877 observation of Mars's channels (mistakenly translated as ""canals"" by others). Mr. Neathery describes a diagram of the planet's orbit between 1956-71 indicating its nearness to the earth every 15 years. Aerology, or the study of the features of Mars, is done with telescope, spectroscope, thermocouple, and camera and reveals polar caps that wax and wane and a reddish color, thought to be desert, covering 75% of the planet's surface. Dr. Neathery shows a cactus in a bell jar containing nitrogen, argon, carbon dioxide, and oxygen in proportions considered similar to those in the Martian atmosphere and compares it to a cactus plant outside the jar. He also uses balloons filled with nitrogen or helium to demonstrate the escape velocity of gravity on earth as compared to the lower surface gravity on Mars. Because oxygen is nearly non-existent on Mars, the temperatures are extreme, and it's unclear whether chlorophyll exists on the planet, Dr. Neathery concludes that Mars is inhospitable to life as we know it. However, he is certain that man's curiosity will take him there. The trip will take eight months, and an artist's rendition shows what will be seen upon landing.

Clarence Rice, aviation products manager of the Bendix Radio Division in Baltimore, MD, points out that aviation navigation depends on knowing the ground speed and the path of the aircraft over the earth. He uses a chart to demonstrate the effects of winds on plane direction and the efforts to compensate: a homing device, which did not account for wind drift and also picked up static interference; the radio range system, which used four beams to overcome the drift problem but still received static; and the manual direction finder, which became the standard aid in the 1930s. A film describes how, in 1939, Bendix developed the automatic direction finder (ADF) with omnirange, which also eliminated static. Over the ocean, LORAN, or long range navigation, devices were used. Another animated film shows how Christian Doppler, in 1842, described the Doppler effect based on sound waves and how that principle has been applied to radar's radio waves. The film explains the ""plus"" Doppler effect for direct measurement of forward speeds and the ""minus"" for measurement of drift angle. Pitch and roll are also corrected by the radar beams since beam compensation is based on the magnitude of the Doppler shift. A plane's Doppler radar components include a transmitter, antennae, receiver, frequency tracker, and cockpit indicator. Mr. Rice explains how pilots divide their flights into shorter legs, placing the information into the navigational computer.

Venus's atmosphere was first thought to be like that of the carboniferous period on earth, but a subsequent spectroscopic study showed nothing but carbon dioxide, permitting no life as we know it. However, the Venusian ocean may support one-celled animals. Mr. Streeter describes the history of speculated life on Venus and shows early sketches of Venusians. Film clips show the 1959 balloon and gondola designed by Johns Hopkins University's Dr. John Strong and piloted by Navy commander Malcolm Ross.

M. Levitt, Director of the Fels Planetarium of Philadelphia's Franklin Institute, describes the shape, characteristics, and historical formation of the moon. He explains that over 30,000 craters have been counted on the moon, including Tycho, and that the dark areas called ""seas"" by Galileo are actually deserts. Dr. Levitt predicts that because of its low gravity and lack of atmosphere the moon will be used as a launching site for exploring the solar system. For the same reasons, the moon is also an ideal place for asthmatics and heart sufferers. He discusses the Saturn rocket project under Wernher von Braun, which will launch a rocket to the moon. He anticipates that between 1962-68 a man will land on the moon, but first robots must probe the lunar surface and gather data such as temperature. A man models a Navy full pressure suit similar to what astronauts will use in their lunar exploration. Dr. Levitt also predicts that within the next 20 years a nearly self-sustaining colony will be established on the moon. Displaying a lunar housing simulation model, Dr. Levitt describes how fuel, water, atmosphere, and quarters can be made from readily available basic elements on the moon and how algae and hydroponics could form the basis of the food supply.

Andrews demonstrates that all matter vibrates in harmonic wave patterns. He begins by using an oscilloscope and slow motion camera to show a plucked harp string's fundamental vibration at 64 times per second and its harmonics at a faster vibration. He compares this with the two-dimensional vibration of a drum membrane, also viewed on the slow motion camera and oscilloscope. Dr. Andrews then progresses to the three-dimensional wavelength of a sphere and notes that different and more complex harmonic patterns are based on the shape of the object. Since no two statues are alike, their wave patterns are all unique, as evidenced when a gadget taps them repetitively and their sound is recorded on magnetic tape. Dr. Andrews slows the tape to hear specific sounds and compares this to slowing a LP record on a record player from high speed to the proper speed to make the words recognizable. He explains that the aggregate vibration of the whole statue is based on its external shape, like atomic and molecular vibration. He points out that the formula for entropy, the measurement of the complexity of harmonic pattern, is the same as the formula for information theory, the measurement of the amount of information in a communication. Thus, a statue has high information value because its complex external shape gives it a high shape entropy and it communicates more meaning.

In the seventh century BC, the Phoenicians circumnavigated Africa and may have sailed to the Azores and Canary Islands. They were followed by the Celts, who journeyed to Iceland and Greenland according to accounts by St. Brendan, who set sail from Ireland between 565-573 and encountered a crystal column in the sea, either an iceberg or glacier. He also possibly sailed to the Azores and Canaries and possibly to Mexico since Cortez discovered, in 1519, that the Aztecs celebrated a blend of paganism and Christianity and spoke of Quetzalcoatl, a legendary white priest. The Vikings or Norse also migrated to Iceland in 874. Around 900 they discovered Vitramannaland, or ""white man's land,"" possibly an Irish settlement in North America. In 930 Gunnbjorn discovered Greenland, and in 982 Erik the Red colonized it. Bjarni Herjulfsson, blown off course, explored part of the American coast unknowingly in 985. Leif Erikson also sailed along the shores of the American continent and established a colony named Vinland the Good, its exact location disputed. Other evidence of pre-Columbian Viking discovery includes maps and the existence of the stone Newport Tower in Rhode Island. Edmund Plowden referred to the tower in a 1632 petition, but this may have been elsewhere than Newport. Additional exploration included that of Giovanni da Verrazzano in 1524, the Venetian expedition in 1398 described in ""The Zeno Narrative"", and the Portuguese discovery of Newfoundland in 1450 and Labrador in 1492.",Public digital access,Science Review,"relators:brd:ABC Television Network||relators:drt:Fryers, Edwin||relators:nrt:Jaffee, Ted||relators:prd:Poole, Lynn||relators:pro:Poole, Lynn||relators:pro:WJZ-TV (Television station : Baltimore, Md.)||relators:aus:Millis, Walter, Jr., 1933-2014",Copyright Not Evaluated,"Originally broadcast as a segment of the television program Johns Hopkins File 7 on April 26, 1959 from the studios of WJZ in Baltimore, Md.

The tropical year is explained with a globe and photographer's lamp as the earth orbits around the sun from vernal equinox to vernal equinox every 365.2422 days, requiring a leap year day to catch up. Calendars based on the moon are soon out of sync with the seasons as they're based on the 29.5-day lunar month, which is why the dates of Passover and Easter fluctuate. Mr. Poole displays an American Indian lunar calendar drawn on buckskin for the period 1865-1892.

Eisenhower introduces this program about the Fund for Adult Education, an independent philanthropic organization sponsored by the Ford Foundation to extend liberal education to adults. He explains that as a society becomes more complex, its need for good leaders increases. Charles H. Percy, president of the Bell and Howell Co. and chairman of the board for the Fund, describes leadership in the United States and public responsibility of its citizens. He points out that particularly because we now have the power to destroy ourselves, the future of society depends on the effectiveness of key people in organizations' leadership roles. The president of the Fund, C. Scott Fletcher, says that leadership comes from a multiple, fluid society, offering a constant supply of fresh people with new ideas. A short film shows how uneducated leaders in a village are unable to meet the challenge of change and take a long-range view. Harry A. Bullis, director of the Fund, explains that leadership training is available to Armed Forces staff and at most private organizations, but top government employees only receive on the job training via trial and error, often at the public's expense. The Fund intends to prepare such individuals for public responsibilities. President of Vassar College and vice-chair of the Fund's board Sarah Gibson Blanding describes leadership in Thomas Jefferson's days and how it developed as society became more complex. While there are opportunities for many types of training, adult leadership training is lacking. She reiterates that continuing liberal adult education is necessary. Leaders must be educated to be dedicated, courageous, and imaginative. Mr. Percy concludes that the threat of Soviet Russia and its success with communism will exist for a long time, so we must educate our leaders as efficiently as they do theirs. He suggests non-commercial educational television as a possible education vehicle.

Carl Jensen, a lighting engineer and marketing manager, and Dr. John McNall, the director of research at Westinghouse Electric Corp., discuss how this light is generated by exciting phosphors in alternating electric fields and demonstrate the concept using a tilting board with traps and marbles. Electro-luminescence was first discovered in 1936 by Georges Destriau, shown in a film clip. The guests also make the analogy of keys on a piano to the full electromagnetic spectrum, from radio waves to gamma waves. They explain that lumens are units of light and watts are units of power, and they compare the brightness of electro-luminescence to incandescent and fluorescent bulbs. The new product can become brighter by increasing the voltage or frequency or both, but it has limits. Dr. McNall shows the electrical conductors and other layers making up this artificial source of light and notes that it can be made into many shapes or designs and installed in ceilings, walls, stairs, furniture, and even drapery. However, square panels are the most common shape, as shown in the top of a coffee table and on the walls of a model room. Scientific use of electro-luminescence includes astronautical instrumentation, and electro-enhancement will lead to less x-ray exposure by intensification of fluoroscopy screens.

Dr. Lawrence Ross, associate professor of English at the Johns Hopkins University, argues that such modern trappings distort Shakespeare's work and Elizabethan times. He explains that the Shakespeare stage was an open air platform with emphasis on the actors and their speech and symbolized the order of the universe with man in the center. The same scene is then performed on the Folger Shakespeare Library's stage in Washington, DC in period costume. Dr. Ross says that Shakespeare's dramatic poetry spoken on the symbolic stage represented the essence of life and that the meanings of Elizabethan words often differed from current ones. Shakespeare's characters are hybrid: part real, part symbol, such as Shylock exacting a pound of flesh in the dramatized scene from ""The Merchant of Venice."" Dr. Ross analyzes a portrait of Queen Elizabeth as an introduction to the Elizabethan order of natural authority: the king ruled over the state, God over the universe, the sun over the planets, the husband over the family, and reason over man.

Dr. William Kellogg, a meteorologist with the Rand Corp., describes the typical orbits of satellites launched from Cape Canaveral, explaining why an elliptical orbit is generally preferable, but a circular one is best for a weather satellite. He also says that the higher the satellite's elevation, the longer it will take to circle the earth but the longer the satellite's lifespan as well. Dr. Fritz stresses the technological problems that need to be overcome before satellites can become more useful tools: stabilization, to make it constantly look down; transmission, interpretation, and distribution of collected data; and measurement of cloud reflectivity. The satellites' benefits to meteorology will include wide range cloud detection, measurement of the heat balances that drive the storms, and measurement of radiation balance over land and water by latitude.

Dr. Carl Bode, English professor at the University of Maryland, analyzes Thoreau's 26-month Walden venture and suggests that Thoreau was experiencing the cycle of withdrawal and return as described by Arnold Toynbee. Dr. Barker discusses Thoreau's animosity towards his peers and his polemic essays, such as the 1849 ""Essay on Civil Disobedience"" and the 1859 ""A Plea for Captain John Brown,"" his last outburst of creative energy. Individualistic and dogmatic to the end, Thoreau died of tuberculosis in 1862. Actor Ed Golden portrays Thoreau and recites lines written by him to underscore the scholars' comments.",Public digital access,Science Review,"relators:brd:ABC Television Network||relators:drt:Fryers, Edwin||relators:nrt:Jaffee, Ted||relators:prd:Barker, Charles A.

Examples of elephant drawings made between 1500 B.C. and 500 A.D. in such diverse places as England, Ceylon, China, and Siam are often stylized or abstract whether the animal is native to the country or not. Similarly, a Greek coin displays an elephant likeness. However, during this period in Central America, Mayan statues, carvings, and writings and Aztec art and rituals distinctly show elephants even though there were none to copy nor anyone to describe them. Thus Dr. Carter maintains that Asian peoples must have brought drawings or statues of elephants to Central America over 2,000 years ago. The proof he offers for this theory is the Thor Heyerdahl transpacific raft voyage (proving such a trip could be made in a primitive vessel), identical temples 12,000 miles apart in Mexico and Cambodia, identical Sumatran and Mexican folding bark religious books, identical fishhooks from Easter Island and California, physical attributes of Central American and Asian Indians (photos show one of each, both playing nose flutes), and plants appearing in lands too far from original sources to have blown there.

He first describes, and displays, sculptures as artistic expressions existing in the round and being representational, semi-representational, or non-representational. He then argues that to understand the purpose of a sculpture, one must consider the culture that produced it and will generally find that it is either humanistic (making a statement about the human condition) or cult (serving as a bridge from this world to the next). As examples of cult objects, Mr. Myers exhibits the bronze head of the dead king of the kingdom of Benin in Nigeria. He also shows an Egyptian rose quartz sculpture of a pharaoh, an 8th century Indian temple corner graced by two dancers, a 14th century French Madonna and child, a second century Gandharan stucco head in the Roman tradition, and a 5th century sculpture similar to a Roman sarcophagus. To contrast humanistic examples of sculpture, Mr. Myers displays the remainder of a Greek Venus sculpture, the ideal of feminine beauty. The neo-humanism of Dante's era led to contemporary individualism as expressed in Maillol's 1898 ""Bather Fixing Her Hair,"" Degas' ""Little Dancer,"" and Matisse's ""Serf,"" ""Reclining Nude,"" and ""Serpentine."" He compares Renoir's 1916 bronze Venus to the ancient one and Henry Moore's abstract ""Reclining Woman"" with previous examples. Mr. Myers maintains that modern artists are the prophets and moralists of society and their return to abstract ideas and figures are a balance of otherworldliness and worldliness, with Venus and the dead king coalescing. He concludes the program showing two abstract metal sculptures: Giacometti's ""Man Pointing"" and Ibram Lassaw's ""Planets.""",Public digital access,Science Review,"relators:brd:ABC Television Network||relators:drt:Fryers, Edwin||relators:nrt:Jaffee, Ted||relators:prd:Myers, Denys Peter, 1916-2003||relators:prd:Poole, Lynn||relators:pro:Geier, Leo, 1926-2017||relators:pro:Poole, Lynn||relators:pro:WJZ-TV (Television station : Baltimore, Md.)||relators:aus:Millis, Walter, Jr., 1933-2014",Copyright Not Evaluated,"Originally broadcast as a segment of the television program Johns Hopkins File 7 on April 3, 1960 from the studios of WJZ in Baltimore, Md.

In one greenhouse two groups of plants are receiving the same daytime conditions, but at night one is kept in total darkness while the other receives eight additional hours of incandescent light. Two four-year old loblolly pines show the results of this experiment. Dr. H. A. Borthwick explains that this is to study photoperiodism, or the effect of light on the plants' growth mechanism. In 1918 Wightman W. Garner and Harry A. Allard discovered that it is not the length of the day but rather of the night that is the determining factor in flower and seed production and growth of plants. Further experiments with lettuce, bean, tomato, and corn seeds test the effect of spectrum light colors and exposure on germination. A far red light creates a taller plant, and red light creates the tomato skin color. The mechanism in a plant the reacts to light is not chlorophyll but rather a two-way growth pigment, phytochrome, that acts as a switch with red and far red light. A film shows the process, using a spectrophotometer, by which this was determined. K. H. Norris demonstrates a spectrophotometer with a corn sample and explains the results with graphs.

Mencken, opens this show on the ""Sage of Baltimore,"" and quotes him throughout the program. Lynn Poole gives a pictorial account of Mencken's early life. Dr. Carl Bode, University of Maryland English professor, discusses Mencken as a critic of literature, society, and politics. He points out Mencken's contentiousness in his writing, especially in political criticism, such as his comments in 1912 on Baltimore mayor James H. Preston. Although Mencken stood up for New Realists such as Dreiser and Hemingway, he disliked the pretentiousness of many authors of his day and spoke out against bestsellers with no literary merit. With Mr. Potter's assistance, Dr. Bode describes events in Mencken's career as editor and columnist with ""The Baltimore Sun"" newspaper, co-editor with George Jean Nathan of ""The Smart Set,"" editor and writer for ""The American Mercury,"" and author of numerous books, such as ""George Bernard Shaw"" and ""The American Language."" Mr. Potter dramatizes a portion of Mencken's obituary for William Jennings Bryan, written after Bryan's death following the 1925 Scopes Trial. In 1926 the Watch and Ward Society of Boston forced off the newsstands Mencken's controversial ""Hatrack"" story in ""The American Mercury,"" but Mencken prevailed. However, his unchanging views became trivial when he failed to recognize and understand the grave implications of the Great Depression or Hitler. Johns Hopkins professor emeritus Kemp Malone discusses Mencken's book ""The American Language,"" which posits that American English was so different from British English that it should have a separate name. As an amateur philologist, Mencken also launched ""American Speech,"" a learned journal, although he considered himself ""a scout for scholars,"" not a scholar himself.

A film clip shows the International Geophysical Year Expedition's ham radio shack (KC4USA) in Antarctica. Dr. Edward Krieg, ham radio operator (W3CAY) and surgeon at Bon Secour Hospital in Baltimore, shows a film clip of a ham radio operators' ""field day"" and explains some of the ham radio lingo, such as ""CQ"" for hello and ""7-3"" for goodbye. He notes that some hams specialize in Morse code, a requirement for getting a radio license from the FCC. A film documents the DX (distance expedition) of six ham operators who sail to Navassa Island to set up a ham station (KC4AF) there.

Dr. Sanford Rosenthal, pharmacologist at the National Institute of Arthritis and Metabolic Diseases in Bethesda, MD, explains the emergency treatment he developed that is recommended in the dramatic scene: one teaspoon of salt plus half teaspoon of baking soda mixed in one quart of cool water and delivered orally to the burn victim at the rate of one quart per twenty pounds of body weight during the first 24 hours and half the amount during the next 24 hours. He explains that since 1942 National Institute of Health (NIH) has studied shock that follows severe injuries such as burns, crushing injuries, and hemorrhage. A film shows the procedure that replicated these types of injuries on female albino mice. Tissue fluid and blood rushing to the wound area result in dehydration, sodium deficiency, and reduced blood volume overall and can be corrected by administering Rosenthal's fluid treatment orally or intravenously. Dr. Kehl Markley, also of NIH, explains a chart comparing the amount of saline treatment to survival rate. He then narrates a film about 1951 experiments with human burn victims in Lima, Peru, where half received saline solution by mouth and half received plasma and glucose by vein. The two groups showed no significant differences after 24 hours, although many burn victims who survive the shock later die from infection.

In it, Dr. George Carter, geography professor at Hopkins, notes that Louis S.B. Leakey found evidence of the earliest primitive man and his tools in Kenya. He then displays revised maps of the world that reveal different land masses during glacial periods, thus allowing the Kenyan man to explore new lands and form colonies over a period of 100,000 years until the glaciers receded and the oceans returned. Dr. Carter discusses the transformation of Kenyan man from an isolated pygmy into modern man with regional or racial characteristics, such as the cave dwelling ""Sinanthropus pekinesis"" in northern China and the Swanscombe man in England. Glacial periods also created a land bridge near the Bering Strait, allowing animals and man to cross from Asia into North America. Tools found in the Americas plus the physical characteristics of early American Indians offer proof of waves of Asian migrations. Survivors of early man include the australoids, europids, and mongoloids. At the conclusion of the program, host Lynn Poole thanks members of the studio, university, and network for their hard work and dedication. John McClay, general manager of station WJZ-TV, expresses his gratitude to Johns Hopkins University and Lynn Poole especially. University president Milton S. Eisenhower thanks everyone responsible for the shows and announces reluctantly that ""File 7"" will not be on the air next season. He says that the ""business of producing, creating, and presenting a weekly program has become increasingly burdensome,"" and because of the University's other commitments, it is unable to produce shows of the high quality expected of Johns Hopkins.

In 1837 Baltimore, Maryland painter Alfred Jacob Miller joined the American Fur Company caravan, with Scottish Captain William Drummond Stewart, to make a visual record of their trip to the fur traders' rendezvous in the Green River Valley of Wyoming. A map shows their route from Independence, Missouri to Oregon. Miller's sketches, later transformed into over 200 watercolors (now preserved in the Walters Art Gallery and displayed on this program) and oil paintings, chronicle such events as buffalo hunts, prairie fires, and river crossings, as well as such landmarks as Chimney Rock, Scott's Bluff, Fort Laramie, Independence Rock, and The Devil's Gate. Miller's paintings also show encounters with Sioux tribes and Black Feet Indians, various tribal members, and Indian women.

To meet military demands for preserved foods during war, Nicholas Appert devised a method of preserving foods by heating them in sealed containers to destroy the bacteria. In 1812 Peter Durand invented the tin can and the first canning factory opened in Great Britain. A dramatization describes a typical 1815 dinner consisting predominantly of pickled, salted, smoked, and dried foods. Thomas Kensett patented Durand's tin cans in the U.S. in 1825. During the Civil War demands for canned foods increased, boosting mass production of the tin cans. Other products began appearing in cans, such as I. W. Lyons' tooth powder for home use; Gerhard Mennen's talcum powder for babies, in a lithographed can with a sprinkle top; and Gilbert Van Camp's pork and beans combination. A selection of 1880s mass produced, decorative tins display a variety of products, many non-perishable. Soldering the tops of cans by hand gave way to open-topped cans that could be seamed shut by machine. The only exception to this were condensed or evaporated milk cans, patented in 1856 by Gail Borden. A film shows a canning factory, producing 30,000 cans per hour, from cutting the tin plate to testing and shipping the final products.

Connolly outlines Project Transit, the first operational navigation satellite system for the use of submarines and surface vessels. He gives credit for this idea to Dr. William Guier and Dr. George Weiffenbach, of the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Lab (APL), who realized that after the launch of Russian Sputnik I they could track its position by observing the Sputnik's Doppler shift. Frank McClure, heard of research at APL, visualized that the opposite would then be true: a satellite in orbit could determine a point of reference on earth. Dr. Richard Kershner, former head of the Terrier surface to air missile program at APL, headed the designing and building of the Transit satellite. Dr. Kershner explains why the Doppler technique is highly accurate, and an animated segment simplifies this phenomenon. Using a chart and a mock up, Dr. Kershner describes the construction and sections of Transit I and how it functions, including its solar cells, radiation shield, and telemetering system. Film clips taken at APL show testing of weights on the satellite as well as the shake test, centrifuge test, and heat/cold tests. Additional film clips show the tracking stations, to monitor the satellite's received signals, in Maryland, New Mexico, and Texas, plus two mobile vans stationed in Washington and Newfoundland. Rear Admiral Connolly discusses the future of this project as it adds more satellites and notes that this television program is the first to reveal Project Transit, ""the practical navigational system of the future."" Host Lynn Poole concludes this twelfth anniversary program by pointing out that it is the oldest program on network television. He reminisces about the four stations on the network (Washington, Baltimore, Philadelphia, and New York) when the first program premiered on March 9, 1948.

Assistant director Dayton Carritt explains that the Institute was founded in 1948 to study the physical and chemical oceanography of the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries and to conduct the academic program in oceanography at Johns Hopkins University. The Bay is 200 miles long, 20 miles wide, and a great natural resource for commercial and recreational users. Dr. Donald Pritchard, director of the Institute, shows viewers such below deck equipment as the pyrheliometer, which measures and records the intensity of solar radiation; and thetri-filter hydrophotometer, which measures the amount of red, green, and blue light that penetrates the various depths of the Bay and indicates the amount of energy in the water available for underwater plant growth. Using a schematic illustration, Dr. Carritt describes the environmental factors affecting plants and organisms in the Bay, such as water currents, temperature, and salinity as well as availability of plant food, oxygen, and animal life. Dick Whaley demonstrates a microscope mounted with a camera to study and record species of organisms such as diatoms. Other instruments read the salinity and temperature of the water, measure the angle of the current, and analyze the amount of dissolved oxygen in water for plant use. Scuba divers Tom Hopkins and Jim Carpenter discuss their apparatus and their Bell and Howell movie camera with underwater lens before going overboard to study the oyster and clam beds for predators and general condition. These are all examples of pure research on the Chesapeake Bay.",Public digital access,Science Review,"relators:brd:ABC Television Network||relators:prd:Carritt, Dayton E.

Andrews and funded by Mrs. William Hale Harkness. Dr. Andrews hypothesizes that all matter is music since all matter in the universe vibrates, and tones and harmonies are made by vibrations. The motion of a plucked violin string and its adjacent string (sympathetic resonance) are shown in slow motion and on an oscilloscope. Dr. Andrews discusses one dimensional harmony, as described by Pythagoras. Two dimensional harmonies are indicated by the fractional overtones of a drum head membrane, which is shown in slow motion and heard electronically enhanced. Three dimensional harmonies result from the contraction and expansion of a sphere; however, differently shaped solids, such as statues, have fractional resonances that produce unique chords or harmonic patterns when vibrating. Four dimensional harmonies come from atom vibration, a wave whose harmonic pattern is displayed by a vibrating sphere. Thus, Dr. Andrews concludes that since an atom is not a particle that vibrates in space, but rather the vibration itself, all matter is in dynamic form or all matter is music. He continues by playing on a piano the chords of tones of atoms produced by different chemical compounds. He also shows and discusses the pattern of Bach's music on an oscilloscope and music composed by Rebekah West Harkness. In conclusion, Dr. Andrews discusses the dynamic form of the human body's symphony and its small chords in the larger universe.",Public digital access,Science Review,"relators:brd:ABC Television Network||relators:prd:Andrews, Donald H.

Eiseley, Provost of the University of Pennsylvania, lectures from material in his 1958 prize-winning book, ""Darwin's Century."" He explains why he teaches and how man's brain receives impressions and profits from experiences. He reads from Charles Darwin's ""Origin of Species"" as well as from Alfred Russel Wallace's work that recognizes man's brain as the totally new factor in the history of life. Man has the ability to invent, progress, and make changes in his surroundings; and man's ethics, arts, and religions determine his cruelty or humaneness. Dr. Eiseley notes that man is relatively young in the total history of life, but with his mechanical inventions and implements of war and power of choice for good or evil, man and his science have made humanity's extinction possible. Showing a chart of anthropoidal skulls of man's ancestors, Dr. Eiseley says the potential destiny of man is unknown. Because of the Cold War, we need to take responsibility now for spiritual greatness.

The 75,000 precise ridges must be so accurately spaced that it requires a special machine to make a diffraction grating. Dr. Henry H. Rowland developed the first one in 1860, but Dr. John Strong refined this machine, the ruling engine, in 1950. Using a model of the machine, Dr. Strong explains the operation of a ruling engine, focusing on the perfect twin screws that are its vital parts. The maker of these screws, David Broadhead, of Wellsville, NY, demonstrates how one cuts one of these screws on a machine lathe. In a film, Wilbur Perry, one of the most accomplished mechanical and optical technicians in making diffraction gratings, constructs parts of the ruling engine, including the diamond used to cut the 75,000 grooves on the aluminum-coated glass.

Dr. Shaw describes the difference between fear and caution and explains that fears are more likely to become pathological than other emotions. Phobias are irrational fears associated with specific objects, usually associated with an intense or unusual experience in childhood. Examples of typical phobias include acrophobia, claustrophobia, xylophobia, dromophobia, agoraphobia, monophobia, zoophobia, ailurophobia, topophobia, and myctophobia. In an experiment to learn if a person could be conditioned to fear, J. B.

He describes the location of Mars and compares its relative size and distance from other planets using a football field model and the length of an imaginary plane flight. Telescopic views of Mars are unclear and photographs are difficult to make; however, polar caps have been seen and their changing size suggests seasons on the planet. The Dutch astronomer Christian Huyghens sketched Mars with continents and oceans, but his view has been disproved. In 1877 Italian astronomer Schiaparelli noted lines, which he called ""canali"" or canals, on the surface of Mars.

The Romans used concrete, made from Mt. Vesuvius's volcanic rock and sand, to construct many of their famous buildings. Mixing concrete is compared to following a recipe since measurement is critical. Furthermore, the chemistry of concrete is such that it requires moisture for 7-10 days to properly harden. Dr. Boyer enumerates the versatility of concrete and shows how pre-casting concrete of precise forms speeds up construction. He then discusses concrete use in bridge building. Because concrete is strong in compression but relatively weak in tensile strength, reinforced concrete with embedded steel was developed in 1850, and pre-stressed concrete, held in a permanent squeeze with steel wires and bars, is now used in bridges and many other applications.",Public digital access,Science Review,"relators:brd:Du Mont Television Network||relators:drt:Cahan, Herbert B.||relators:drt:Calfee, Kennard||relators:nrt:Jaffee, Ted||relators:prd:Boyer, Walter C.||relators:prd:Poole, Lynn||relators:pro:Poole, Lynn||relators:pro:WAAM (Television station : Baltimore, Md.)",Copyright Not Evaluated,"Originally broadcast as a segment of the television program Johns Hopkins science review on February 17, 1954 from the studios of WAAM in Baltimore, Md.

Latin began as the language of Rome and its vicinity, but through many conquests the Romans spread the use of Latin to the rest of Italy and what is now France, Spain, and North Africa. The Romans also conquered Greece, but since Green was also a highly developed literary language, the Greeks retained their own language. Latin also became the language of the Roman Catholic Church and medieval universities. Many scientific discoveries made during the Renaissance and the early modern period were given names in Latin. Even today Latin names such as Zea mays (corn) are used in scientific communication. Carl von Linné or Carolus Linneaus in Latin classified life forms in an orderly way using Latin terms. In his classification of kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus and species, a dog would be animal, chordata, mammalia, carnivora, canidae, canis familiarus. The Babylonians were fond of the number 60, which is retained today in 60 seconds in a minute, and 60 minutes in an hour, and even 360 degrees in a circle, which is 6 times 60.

A film by the U.S. Dept. of Interior then shows the historical use of the Colorado River. In the late 1800s, Thomas Blythe acquired 40,000 acres in Palo Verde Valley, California and filed the first water rights to the river. In 1867 Jack Swilling built the first irrigation canals in Arizona. By diverting water from the river to land, the southwest began to thrive. However, floods, such as the one that created Salton Sea in 1905, alternating with droughts required a plan to stabilize the flow of the Colorado. Arthur Powell Davis, Director of the U. S. Reclamation Service, proposed a dam, and the Boulder Canyon Project Act was passed in 1928. In 1931 dam construction was begun in Black Canyon, and Hoover Dam (called Boulder Dam from 1933-1946) was completed in 1936, two years ahead of schedule. The resulting Lake Mead, named in honor of U. S. Reclamation Commissioner Dr. Elwood Mead, extends over 100 miles upstream, can hold 2 years of flow from the Colorado River, and has become a very popular recreation area for water sports.",Public digital access,Science Review,"relators:brd:Du Mont Television Network||relators:prd:Poole, Lynn||relators:pro:Poole, Lynn||relators:pro:WAAM (Television station : Baltimore, Md.)",Copyright Not Evaluated,"Originally broadcast as a segment of the television program Johns Hopkins science review on August 5, 1954 from the studios of WAAM in Baltimore, Md.

Skin, covering approximately 18 square feet, is a human's largest organ and serves as the body's protection. Using both live animals from the Baltimore Zoo and representations of animals, Dr. Sullivan explains their protective mechanisms: the lizard's skin changes color for camouflage; the duck's preen gland maintains its feathers with a precursor of vitamin D; the rat's sebaceous glands repel lice; the lion's mane protects it from other animals' bites; and a turtle's shell, a porcupine's quills, and a pachyderm's thick skin all protect the animal within. Dr. Sullivan draws a diagram of the layers of human skin, stressing the epidermis and protective barrier that prevents water from penetrating skin. He notes that a frog has no transitional layer, so its skin can take up water. The human sweat glands continuously secrete a wet film on the skin.

Dr. Bugher, of the Atomic Energy Commission, claims that the use of nuclear energy has advanced medicine by 25 years. For example, radioactive isotopes can be used to study the actual functioning and behavior of plants and animals, to trace and diagnose diseases such as thyroid problems, and to treat and cure diseases such as polycythemia, a form of cancer. He also demonstrates a thulium x-ray unit and narrates a short film showing cobalt-60 radiation of a patient with cancer. Gamma radiation is compact, reliable, and intense.

The device purporting it is actually a Crookes' radiometer that merely demonstrates the facts of radiation. Davies then discusses the navigational issues confronting Columbus and his sailors, such as the differences in distances from the magnetic poles to the actual poles and the strength of the tradewinds. Poole exhibits a copy of ""The Story of Maps"", written by Peabody librarian Lloyd A. Brown, which mentions an astrolabe, like that used by Columbus.

Dr. Harry F. Klinefelter, of the Johns Hopkins Hospital, explains charts showing the mechanical, metabolic, degenerative, and psychological complications of obesity as well as the issues of decreased life expectancy, malignant disease (cancer), and cirrhosis of the liver. He points out that the basic problem is overeating, or taking in more calories than the body requires for energy. However, since the basal metabolism and average daily metabolism varies by person, two people of similar build may have quite different food requirements. Dr. Klinefelter compares people to cars of similar size that get different mileage due to variations in their engine construction and design. He displays average height and weight tables, which don't consider body build and bone structure, and thus are merely guidelines. Dr. Eugene Meyer, psychiatrist at Johns Hopkins, discusses the psychological factors in weight reduction. Compulsive eating begins when one habitually seeks comfort and satisfaction through eating, creating the cycle described by Dr. Hilde Bruch. This pattern may also begin by filling a sense of loss or emptiness with food or by mothers habitually consoling a child with food. Dr. Klinefelter explains that for weight reduction fat must be metabolically burned. Massage and strenuous exercise are both ineffectual in doing this. Since losing more than two pounds per week is dangerous, Dr. Klinefelter recommends a long-term balanced diet, limiting high calorie foods such as bread, potatoes, butter, and cereal and eliminating sweets. He also suggests eating three small meals each day, drinking 6-8 glasses of water per day, using the normal amount of salt, eating a well-balanced diet, and weighing only every two weeks on the same scale and the same time of day.",Public digital access,Science Review,"relators:brd:Du Mont Television Network||relators:prd:Klinefelter, Harry F.||relators:prd:Meyer, Eugene, 1915-||relators:prd:Poole, Lynn||relators:pro:WAAM (Television station : Baltimore, Md.)",Copyright Not Evaluated,"Broadcast as a segment of the television program Johns Hopkins science review on July 15, 1953 which was a rebroadcast of the program that was originally aired on September 22, 1952 from the studios of WAAM in Baltimore, Md.

Lynn Poole honors the scientists currently attending the 90th annual meeting of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS), presided over by Johns Hopkins University's president, Detlev Bronk. Poole describes highlights in the history of the organization, such as Congress' legalization of use of the metric system in 1866 and creation of the U.S. Forest Service in 1896, both based on recommendations of NAS. In 1916 NAS established the National Research Council, and through the efforts of its first chairman, George Ellery Hale, and Dr. Robert A. Millikan, President Woodrow Wilson requested NAS to perpetuate the Council. The remainder of the program explains and demonstrates misconceptions about scientific facts: a copper penny can not substitute for a burned out fuse; small flies are not offspring of large flies (houseflies, blow flies, and stable flies are all in their adult stages); spontaneous generation of rags into mice or horse hair into worms does not occur; people can not be hypnotized against their will; frozen body parts should not be rubbed with snow; ice does not make anything near it very cold (as an experiment with liquid nitrogen shows); water will not put out any fire (water on potassium will start a fire); oysters are also edible in months not containing ""r""; mentally ill people can be cured; and mothers do not ""mark"" their babies before birth. Lynn Poole concludes the program by asking viewers to send him their requests for previous programs they would like repeated in June.",Public digital access,Science Review,"relators:brd:Du Mont Television Network||relators:drt:Kane, Paul||relators:nrt:Jaffee, Ted||relators:prd:Poole, Lynn||relators:pro:Poole, Lynn||relators:pro:WAAM (Television station : Baltimore, Md.)",Copyright Not Evaluated,"Originally broadcast as a segment of the television program Johns Hopkins science review on April 29, 1953 from the studios of WAAM in Baltimore, Md.

Man has wondered about the universe around him since prehistoric times, noticing the movement of the stars and planets. Early in the 20th century the Zeiss planetarium was developed and built in six cities in the United States. After World War II, Armand Spitz produced the Spitz planetarium which made it much more economical for smaller sites to have planetariums. There are now over one hundred in the United States. Mr. Spitz discusses how these planetariums work. He has also designed a toy planetarium that can project images of the stars and planets in the home.",Public digital access,Science Review,"relators:brd:Du Mont Television Network||relators:drt:Cahan, Herbert B.||relators:drt:Calfee, Kennard||relators:nrt:Chaseman, Joel||relators:prd:Poole, Lynn||relators:prd:Spitz, Armand||relators:pro:Poole, Lynn||relators:pro:WAAM (Television station : Baltimore, Md.)",Copyright Not Evaluated,"Originally broadcast as a segment of the television program Johns Hopkins science review on September 19, 1954 from the studios of WAAM in Baltimore, Md.

He comments on designs typically found in rooms in 1900 and 1926 and shows how they've been improved. His 1951 book, Never leave well enough alone, recommends simplifying goods and improving them to lower their manufacturing costs.

In 1900 only sixteen kinds of metal were used by American industry, but at the time of this program, there are 321 known metals and alloys. Lynn Poole shows a piece of a new metal, Fiberfrax, that doesn't get hot when heated. Dr. Maddin, associate professor of metallurgy at Johns Hopkins University, discusses the inside of metal and shows a model of atoms in a perfect metal and one with deviations or imperfections. Mr. Poole notes that only 460 metallurgists are being trained in 45 colleges each year but at least three times that number are needed each year for the next ten years. Dr. Hollomon, head of the metallurgy and ceramic research division of General Electric (GE), lists common metal products and discusses how metals, such as titanium alloys, must be made stronger to withstand the higher temperatures occurring at faster jet speeds and to solve the problem of fractured pipelines and ships. There are career opportunities for chemist metallurgists, involving ingots and arch melting; process metallurgists, researching the forces in metals; development metallurgists, testing stresses and corrosion of metals; and research metallurgists, looking inside metals. Dr. Hollomon recommends studying math, physics, and chemistry in high school to begin the path to becoming a metallurgist.

Willis Gore, Johns Hopkins University assistant professor of electrical engineering, points out that an engineer both creates or invents and operates what he has produced. He uses a servosystem to demonstrate two branches of electric engineering: communications (electronics) and power (generation and utilization of power). Thomas Trice, superintendent of electrical operations of Baltimore Gas and Electric, says that electrical engineering has emerged as a leading profession as electrical demand has increased dramatically since 1910. A film of the electrical planning process stresses reliability of service, safety, and cost of a design. An electrical power analyzer is shown and explained as are meters and relays designed for accuracy and dependability at the Herbert A. Wagner electric generating station in Baltimore. Another film follows the generation of electricity from the coal pile through an electrical power plant and over wires to various customers. George Bisset, senior vice president of Potomac Electric Power Co. in Washington, DC, discusses the shortage of electrical engineers, noting that atomic energy will not replace electrical energy, and that use will at least double every ten years.

Dr. Iler, research manager of the Grasselli Chemical Dept. at E. I. duPont de Nemours and Co., defines chemistry and chemical reactions and lists everyday products created from chemical reactions. In agriculture, fertilizers, insecticides, fungicides, herbicides, and feed supplements for livestock and poultry are all chemical creations. The process to develop a new product involves organic chemists; physical chemists; analytical chemists; biologists; chemical, mechanical, and electrical engineers; and often soil chemists and biochemists. A film shows how research results applied to farm production result in greater output with less labor. The goal of agricultural research chemists is to create new knowledge, processes, and products, and improve present ones, for plants and animals. Dr. Iler notes that 90% of all chemicals tested are inadequate. He then explains the steps required to test a new fungicide chemical, beginning with making the chemicals easily mixable with water for spraying on plants and ending with analysis of the resulting fruit with a colorimeter to test for chemical absorption. He also briefly comments on chemicals in cattle dips and sprays to control insects and parasites on livestock.

He discusses the increase in size and complexity of man's brain compared to apes' and compares several skulls as evidence of man's probable evolution from apes. Dr. Straus also considers a skull from Pithecanthropus man from Java. A film clip of gibbons indicates their similarity to man in many respects. Dr. Eiseley explains a map of early man's migration related to his eating practices and increased brain capacity. He also shows photographs of archaeological sites in Oregon yielding 10,000-30,000 year-old fossils as well as Folsom man projectile points found in New Mexico. He explains that findings can be dated by geological strata, paleontological research of bones, and anatomical determination of human skeleton ages.

Colonel Mason, a graduate of Harvard and student of John Gallishaw, is the author of numerous historical novels and juvenile books, some translated into 18 languages. He maintains that waiting for inspiration is nonsense and that the writer should keep regular hours. His method of composition is to dictate his stories to a secretary who transcribes the drafts on yellow, then blue, then white paper. Colonel Mason explains that the two types of novels are stories of accomplishment and stories of decision. The elements of any story should include who, when, where, and how and should create urgencies or crises, as his impromptu story exemplifies. He describes his travels and research for his most recently published book, Silver Leopard, about the First Crusade, and displays his research notebook for his current work, Our Valiant Few, about the Civil War. His advice to young writers is to study with a competent teacher, write daily, don't quit your job after selling your first story, and remember that writing is more perspiration than inspiration. The second guest, Holmes Alexander, studied and wrote at Princeton and Cambridge. He then taught writing at the McDonough School, a private Baltimore school, and wrote book reviews and other pieces. When he was elected to the Maryland legislature, he wrote about his campaign and sold the story to Harpers. After that he became a reporter with The Baltimore Sun, covering county politics and Johns Hopkins University. He wrote biographies of Martin Van Buren and Aaron Burr as well as other books, nonfiction articles on horses, and fictional baseball stories, which he sold to such magazines as Saturday Evening Post, Colliers, and Esquire. He became Kiplinger's senior editor and ultimately a syndicated columnist. His advice to aspiring writers is to go where the trouble is to get the news, be able to write anywhere, and ignore obstacles to writing. A party at the end of this program celebrates the eighth year of Johns Hopkins programs with WAAM and the first anniversary of ""Tomorrow's Careers."" Herbert Cahan hosts the party, Mrs. Kennard Calfee presents the cake, and Lynn Poole introduces the staff. In addition to those normally appearing in the credits, he includes Dick Zibner (new assistant producer), Andy Bevins (floor manager), John Stokes and Allen Holmes (cameramen), and mentions Herman and Ben Cohen (of WAAM Network) and John Charles Daly (of ABC).",Public digital access,Science Review,"relators:brd:ABC Television Network||relators:drt:Cahan, Herbert B.||relators:drt:Calfee, Kennard||relators:nrt:Jaffee, Ted||relators:prd:Poole, Lynn||relators:prd:Webster, Nicholas||relators:pro:Poole, Lynn||relators:pro:WAAM (Television station : Baltimore, Md.)||relators:spk:Alexander, Holmes, 1906-1985||relators:spk:Mason, F. van Wyck (Francis van Wyck), 1901-1978",Copyright Not Evaluated,"Originally broadcast as a segment of the television program Tomorrow's careers on March 6, 1956 from the studios of WAAM in Baltimore, Md.

Diagnosis sometimes depends of laboratory aids to confirm clinical impressions. Microscopic changes can be recognized to help determine the management and treatment of dermatoses. The understanding of the physiology of the skin and the diagnosis of skin conditions and diseases are necessary for the dermatologist. Treatment methods are more diversified than in any other medical specialty. There are internal medications such as anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, anti-histamines, hormones, sedatives and injectable medications. Topical therapy uses lotions, ointments, soaps, and compresses. Other treatments include physical therapy, ultraviolet light, x-ray and radium therapy, cryotherapy, and surgery. The influence of professors and teachers is very important in guiding students into the various aspects of medicine. In fact the teachers must be constantly learning as post-graduates to keep up with the latest developments to stay in touch with their students.

He comments that a railroad is never complete because of its responsibility to change in industry. Mr. Henry explains the car classification operation at Conway Yard near Pittsburgh, and a film further elaborates on the process, including the role of the hump conductor. Railroad engineers must see the overall picture to construct a line with minimum cost and maximum efficiency. For example, they must find the best route by using aerial photography. Film clips show techniques developed by engineers to unload shipments of foreign ore onto railroad cars. Electronic and mechanical engineers also develop new railway technology, such as track safety features; maintain rolling stock, as at the Hollidaysburg, PA freight car repair shop; and design experimental passenger cars, such as the stainless steel Budd cars and the GM Aerotrain.
