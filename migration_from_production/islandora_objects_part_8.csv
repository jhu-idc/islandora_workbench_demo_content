In 1900 only sixteen kinds of metal were used by American industry, but at the time of this program, there are 321 known metals and alloys. Lynn Poole shows a piece of a new metal, Fiberfrax, that doesn't get hot when heated. Dr. Maddin, associate professor of metallurgy at Johns Hopkins University, discusses the inside of metal and shows a model of atoms in a perfect metal and one with deviations or imperfections. Mr. Poole notes that only 460 metallurgists are being trained in 45 colleges each year but at least three times that number are needed each year for the next ten years. Dr. Hollomon, head of the metallurgy and ceramic research division of General Electric (GE), lists common metal products and discusses how metals, such as titanium alloys, must be made stronger to withstand the higher temperatures occurring at faster jet speeds and to solve the problem of fractured pipelines and ships. There are career opportunities for chemist metallurgists, involving ingots and arch melting; process metallurgists, researching the forces in metals; development metallurgists, testing stresses and corrosion of metals; and research metallurgists, looking inside metals. Dr. Hollomon recommends studying math, physics, and chemistry in high school to begin the path to becoming a metallurgist.

Willis Gore, Johns Hopkins University assistant professor of electrical engineering, points out that an engineer both creates or invents and operates what he has produced. He uses a servosystem to demonstrate two branches of electric engineering: communications (electronics) and power (generation and utilization of power). Thomas Trice, superintendent of electrical operations of Baltimore Gas and Electric, says that electrical engineering has emerged as a leading profession as electrical demand has increased dramatically since 1910. A film of the electrical planning process stresses reliability of service, safety, and cost of a design. An electrical power analyzer is shown and explained as are meters and relays designed for accuracy and dependability at the Herbert A. Wagner electric generating station in Baltimore. Another film follows the generation of electricity from the coal pile through an electrical power plant and over wires to various customers. George Bisset, senior vice president of Potomac Electric Power Co. in Washington, DC, discusses the shortage of electrical engineers, noting that atomic energy will not replace electrical energy, and that use will at least double every ten years. He recommends that interested students take physics and math courses and consult a vocational counselor, college, or local electric company for additional advice.

Dr. Iler, research manager of the Grasselli Chemical Dept. at E. I. duPont de Nemours and Co., defines chemistry and chemical reactions and lists everyday products created from chemical reactions. In agriculture, fertilizers, insecticides, fungicides, herbicides, and feed supplements for livestock and poultry are all chemical creations. The process to develop a new product involves organic chemists; physical chemists; analytical chemists; biologists; chemical, mechanical, and electrical engineers; and often soil chemists and biochemists. A film shows how research results applied to farm production result in greater output with less labor. The goal of agricultural research chemists is to create new knowledge, processes, and products, and improve present ones, for plants and animals. Dr. Iler notes that 90% of all chemicals tested are inadequate. He then explains the steps required to test a new fungicide chemical, beginning with making the chemicals easily mixable with water for spraying on plants and ending with analysis of the resulting fruit with a colorimeter to test for chemical absorption. He also briefly comments on chemicals in cattle dips and sprays to control insects and parasites on livestock. Dr. Iler says that curiosity, a background in math and sciences, and a college degree are necessities to become a chemist or chemical engineer.

Coon's The Story of Man to introduce this program on anthropology. Loren Eiseley discusses the range and depth of anthropology and some of its branches, such as cultural, physical, and applied anthropology. William Straus, who specializes in primates and evolution, introduces Dr. Tom, a chimpanzee. He discusses the increase in size and complexity of man's brain compared to apes' and compares several skulls as evidence of man's probable evolution from apes. Dr. Straus also considers a skull from Pithecanthropus man from Java. A film clip of gibbons indicates their similarity to man in many respects. Dr. Eiseley explains a map of early man's migration related to his eating practices and increased brain capacity. He also shows photographs of archaeological sites in Oregon yielding 10,000-30,000 year-old fossils as well as Folsom man projectile points found in New Mexico.

Martin Company of Baltimore, discusses Project Vanguard, the U.S. contribution to the 1957-58 International Geophysical Year. He shows a three-stage rocket and a diagram of its launch and various stages. It will circle the earth in an elliptical orbit every 90 minutes for several weeks, sending back scientific data during that time. A film of White Sands Proving Grounds shows the Martin Company's Viking high altitude rocket, the first designed by the Naval Research Laboratory for scientific research and the Vanguard's first stage. A camera in its tail records the curvature of the earth and other information about its flight. The film also shows the fires and crashes of previous Viking failures as well as the launch of the first Viking from the deck of the U.S.S. Norton Sound while carrying instruments. Lynn Poole interviews three of the project's engineers: Elliott Felt, who explains how the automatic pilot works; Don Markarian, who explains the fins on the Viking rocket for roll control and other details on a model of the craft; and Leonard Arnowitz, who shows an actual Viking motor. Mr. Trimble says the qualities of a rocket engineer include a pioneering spirit and a desire to create something new. He also notes that an engineering degree is important, but 40% of his employees do not have one, taking current technical and science courses instead.

Guest Gene Bordinat, vice president of Ford Motor Co. in charge of styling and assistant to George W. Walker, is the chief designer of the Mercury. He explains that in designing a car, he must consider not only what the American public wants but also management's bottom line, since a complete body and chassis change costs the company $75 million. Because of automotive competition, Bordinat can not show forthcoming models, but he does display some ""dream cars,"" such as the XM Turnpike Cruiser and the Taj Mahal, which are impractical to produce but which offer design features applicable to practical cars. He enumerates the steps in creating new models from design to production, including engineering, manufacturing, financing, and safety considerations. A film shows the Ford assembly line and testing labs. Bordinat shows a typical 3/8 scale clay model of the XM Turnpike Cruiser and discusses its design features and proportions.

Colonel Mason, a graduate of Harvard and student of John Gallishaw, is the author of numerous historical novels and juvenile books, some translated into 18 languages. He maintains that waiting for inspiration is nonsense and that the writer should keep regular hours. His method of composition is to dictate his stories to a secretary who transcribes the drafts on yellow, then blue, then white paper. Colonel Mason explains that the two types of novels are stories of accomplishment and stories of decision. The elements of any story should include who, when, where, and how and should create urgencies or crises, as his impromptu story exemplifies. He describes his travels and research for his most recently published book, Silver Leopard, about the First Crusade, and displays his research notebook for his current work, Our Valiant Few, about the Civil War. His advice to young writers is to study with a competent teacher, write daily, don't quit your job after selling your first story, and remember that writing is more perspiration than inspiration. The second guest, Holmes Alexander, studied and wrote at Princeton and Cambridge. He then taught writing at the McDonough School, a private Baltimore school, and wrote book reviews and other pieces. When he was elected to the Maryland legislature, he wrote about his campaign and sold the story to Harpers. After that he became a reporter with The Baltimore Sun, covering county politics and Johns Hopkins University. He wrote biographies of Martin Van Buren and Aaron Burr as well as other books, nonfiction articles on horses, and fictional baseball stories, which he sold to such magazines as Saturday Evening Post, Colliers, and Esquire. He became Kiplinger's senior editor and ultimately a syndicated columnist. His advice to aspiring writers is to go where the trouble is to get the news, be able to write anywhere, and ignore obstacles to writing. A party at the end of this program celebrates the eighth year of Johns Hopkins programs with WAAM and the first anniversary of ""Tomorrow's Careers."" Herbert Cahan hosts the party, Mrs. Kennard Calfee presents the cake, and Lynn Poole introduces the staff.

Treatment methods are more diversified than in any other medical specialty. There are internal medications such as anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, anti-histamines, hormones, sedatives and injectable medications. Topical therapy uses lotions, ointments, soaps, and compresses. Other treatments include physical therapy, ultraviolet light, x-ray and radium therapy, cryotherapy, and surgery.

He comments that a railroad is never complete because of its responsibility to change in industry. Mr. Henry explains the car classification operation at Conway Yard near Pittsburgh, and a film further elaborates on the process, including the role of the hump conductor. Railroad engineers must see the overall picture to construct a line with minimum cost and maximum efficiency. For example, they must find the best route by using aerial photography. Film clips show techniques developed by engineers to unload shipments of foreign ore onto railroad cars. Electronic and mechanical engineers also develop new railway technology, such as track safety features; maintain rolling stock, as at the Hollidaysburg, PA freight car repair shop; and design experimental passenger cars, such as the stainless steel Budd cars and the GM Aerotrain. Carl Bergman notes that inspecting and maintaining track and allied structures acquaints railroad engineers in training with all aspects of the job, even though most maintenance jobs are now mechanized. He explains the composition and construction of a track and narrates a film showing a machine that detects defects in the rail and other maintenance equipment. Both men recommend that interested high school students take math and general science courses followed by a college degree in engineering.

A film shows Dr. Russell S. Fisher, lecturer in forensic medicine at Johns Hopkins University and chief medical examiner for the state of Maryland, at work in his lab. He is assisted by a team consisting of a secretary, chemists, a photographic specialist, doctors, police, and specialists in the physical sciences. In dealing with crimes of violence or mysterious death, Dr. Fisher asks: Who is the victim? Is it murder or suicide? When did it happen? How did it happen? Who did it? He shows a photo of a charred body and explains when and how the death occurred and the importance of an autopsy and a post-mortem examination. Dr. Fisher compares blood samples and explains how they are used by a courtroom doctor to exonerate or convict the accused. Using sketches from Lynn Poole's book ""Science, the Super Sleuth,"" Dr. Fisher describes what he looks for in knifing murders. He also tells the case of the arsenic in the pancake flour and demonstrates how the presence of arsenic was confirmed. Lynn Poole shows snapshots of Dr. Fisher as a student in the toxicology lab at Georgia Tech as well as photos from throughout his career in forensic medicine.
